## Class projects I've worked on:
- Investigations in Molecular Biology lab: Analyzed the potential for Neurospora crassa orthologs of Saccharomyces cerevisiae MET17 genes to complement deficiencies in S. cerevisiae met strains
- Sustainable Agriculture: Researched and analyzed the state of sustainable agriculture in Vietnam, how Vietnam can improve, and what challenges Vietnam will face
- Geographic Information System: Constructed flood maps of Boston at different degrees of sea level rise, storm surges, and produced suggestions for what neighborhoods can do to avoid the damage while still maintaining visual appeal
- Geography of Global Cities: Surveyed and analyzed beach residents’ satisfaction with a recent beach renewal project that involved reconstructing the sand dunes, beach topography, and nearby commercial area
- Microbiomes: Created a blog to look at how the microbiomes around coral reefs can improve their resilience towards climate change, warming oceans, and acidification
- Plant physiological Ecology: Conducted a survey in West Australia about the status and progress of a mine rehabilitation site by measuring plant respiration rates and morphology. Camped out in the desert for a week in order to measure multiple plots that had different planting conditions
- Environmental Seminar: Led discussion on trash and waste in the ocean, conducted a study on BC food waste to see whether living on or off campus produced more food waste.  Presented findings at a research symposium
- Human-Wildlife Conflicts & Interactions: Conducted a study on Cape Cod residents/visitors about their perception on rewilding and what they knew about it using in-person surveys
- Social innovation and entrepreneurship: Wrote a 30 page business plan on the viability and profitability of an indoor aquaponic farm in Dorchester elementary schools. The primary customers would be schools that buy pre-packaged/prepared meals. There would also be potential to sell to parents that come to pick their kids up. The project’s main aim was to tackle food deserts, provide fresh and nutritious food for kids, and allow students the ability to learn and interact with the farm. A secondary goal was to provide a small market place where parents could buy some fresh produce as they’re picking up their kids, cutting down on time needed to grocery shop and prepare meals
- International Environmental Science & Policy: Wrote a mock-memo to the US Senate advocating for the benefit of seaweed as an offshore aquaculture initiative that could help prevent algal blooms by sucking up excess nitrogen runoff, provide habitat for fish which will revitalize local fisheries, and the ability of seaweed to grow fast without any fertilizer or water while sequestering carbon. Wrote a mock-resolution to the UNFAO as the Netherlands advocating for agriculture reform
