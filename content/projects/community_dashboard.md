Community Dashboard is an ongoing web project I’m building to make local information more practical at the neighborhood scale. It combines a curated directory of small businesses, services, and events with card-based layouts, search, and filters so people can quickly find what’s relevant to them without digging through multiple apps or review sites. The goal is to prototype a lightweight “local home page” for a neighborhood—something that could eventually highlight new openings, recurring events, local deals, and useful community resources in one place.
