# Howdy!


![Hung](/images/profile.jpg)

My name is Hung Tran and I am a graduate of the MBA in sustainability program at Bard and a Product Manager at CDP. Before CDP and Bard, I studied Biology and Environmental Studies from Boston College (BC). My main interests lie in Sustainability, Coastal Communities, and Data Analysis. Coastal communities are among the first impacted by climate change so I hope to help out in any way that I can.  


## Projects that I've worked on include:

- Pro-bono consulting for small businesses and individuals on what their environmental impact is, how to review and measure it, and steps they can take to change this. 

- Webscraping data from social media sites and forums like Twitter and Reddit in order to build a sentiment/hype tracker for stocks. This will be combined with ESG data that I found from various reports/self-reported from companies in order to determine the prospects of short term investing and long term investing.

- Utilizing Google Trends in order to determine if there has been a shift ESG adoption and other environmental related terms. So far, most terms have remained steady in their search history since 2004, but searches for ESG has increased significantly. 

- Created a blog to look at how the microbiomes around coral reefs can improve their resilience towards climate change, warming oceans, and acidification 

- Conducted a survey in West Australia about the status and progress of a mine rehabilitation site by measuring plant respiration rates and morphology. Camped out in the desert for a week in order to measure multiple plots that had different planting conditions.

- Wrote a 30 page business plan on the viability and profitability of an indoor aquaponic farm in elementary schools
