How I can help with data, climate, or workflow problems.

Consult with small businesses and individuals to evaluate their environment impact and what they can do to change

## What i've done
- Walked individuals through what industries have a high environmental impact, what companies to avoid buying from, who is setting goals and meeting them, and what products have a long life cycle/can be repurposed.

- Helped a restaurant look at their supply chain to determine where they can afford to go local, approximate their carbon footprint, reduce food waste by streamlining menu and implementing preference system for customers in order to see which items were popular

- Coordinated with a laundromat in order to determine their water and electricity load and costs, how much they would save from adopting energy efficient Energy Star certified washers and dryers, and finding a more environmentally friendly detergent for customers

- Researched how a nail salon can switch to more environmentally friendly nail polishes and sustainably sourced sponges for feet
